KNIDIRI MEHDI's Bioinformatics Portfolio

## Profile Info
I am an accomplished student with hands-on experience in science, particularly in genetics, epigenetics, and bioinformatics.
Currently, I am in the intermediate stages of learning Python and R for genomic data analysis. 
With a strong foundation in genetics, I am excited to deepen my skills in these languages to contribute to the world of molecular biology.
My goal is to decode the genome's secrets and enhance our understanding of gene expression and regulation.
